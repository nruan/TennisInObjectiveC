# Tennis_Sim_Obj-C
Tennis simulator
Simulates a tennis match and calculates the winner based on the probability of each player winning when they serve. This was my first attempt at programming in Objective-C and was completed for my capstone class, Advanced Software Design. Some of the files
such as the game, gamescore, player, and pointscore files were originally created by my Proffessor, Dr. Ali Kooshesh, and were later modified by me. All other files were created and implemented by me.
